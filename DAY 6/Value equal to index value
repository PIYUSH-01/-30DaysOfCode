//33. Value equal to index value - GFG (https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/value-equal-to-index-value1330/1)
//Given an array Arr of N positive integers. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value.

//CONSTRAINTS
/*
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 106
*/


/*
	I/P O/P Examples
    
    1. I/P:- N = 5
			 Arr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7}
    
    2. O/P:- 2
    
    Explanation: Only Arr[2] = 2 exists here.

*/

/*
	Approach:- 
    1. Create a vector and then traverse the whole vector and while traversing look for the elements that have their values and their position(It's POSITION not INDEX MIND IT) in the vector same.
    2. Along with looking for that kind of elements keep pushing back the position in the new vector.
    3. Finally return the Vector.

//CODE:-

class Solution{
public:

	vector<int> valueEqualToIndex(int arr[], int n) {
	    vector<int> returning;
	    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	        if(arr[i] == i+1)
	            returning.push_back(i+1);
	    }
	    return returning;
	}
