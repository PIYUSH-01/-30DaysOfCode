//REVERSE STRING - LEETCODE 344. - https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/
//Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
//You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

//!!MAJOR LEARNING!!:- Don't forget to use the '&' operator to create the 'call by reference' type function 'SWAP' to reflect the changes back to 'main'. Otherwise the swapped results won't reflect in 'main'.

/*
	I/P O/P EXAMPLES
    
    	1. I/P:- ["h","e","l","l","o"]
           O/P:- ["o","l","l","e","h"]
           
        2. I/P:- ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
           O/P:- ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
*/

/*
	CONSTRAINTS:
	Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
*/

/*
	APPROACH:
    1. Take a variable halfSize and compute the size of the given string and then divide it by half.
    2. Run the 'for loop' 'halfSize' times and each time SWAP one element from left with one element from right which will depend on the value of 'i'.
    3. After swapping all the elements from left with right just print out the string using the 'for loop'.

//CODE:

class Solution {
public:
  	//Function to swap the characters of the string.
    void swap(char &a, char &b) {
        a = a + b;
        b = a - b;
        a = a - b;
    }
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int halfSize = 0;
        halfSize = s.size() / 2;
        for(int i = 0; i <= halfSize-1; i++) //To reverse the string
            swap(s[i], s[s.size() - 1 - i]);
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) //To print the reversed string.
            cout << s[i];
    }
